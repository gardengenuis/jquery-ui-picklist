=Introduction=

Several callback events were added to the widget to facilitate extending or altering the functionality without having to directly modify the widget's source code. This page documents what events are exposed and how to use them.

==beforeBuild==

This event is triggered just before the picklist widget is initially built. This happens only once, when the widget is first initialized.

====Code Example====

Supply a callback function to handle the `beforeBuild` event as an init option.

{{{
    $(".selector").pickList(
    {
        beforeBuild: function() { ... }
    });
}}}

Bind to the `beforeBuild` event by type: `pickListbeforeBuild`.

{{{
    $(".selector").bind( "pickListbeforeBuild", function() {
        ...
    });
}}}

==afterBuild==

This event is triggered just after the picklist widget is initially built. This happens only once, when the widget is first initialized.

====Code Example====

Supply a callback function to handle the `afterBuild` event as an init option.

{{{
    $(".selector").pickList(
    {
        afterBuild: function() { ... }
    });
}}}

Bind to the `afterBuild` event by type: `pickListafterBuild`.

{{{
    $(".selector").bind( "pickListafterBuild", function() {
        ...
    });
}}}
